    <p>
        Missing Piece is a class group project created by Nik Stires, Connor Mackenzie, and Darren Jonany. Our goal was
        and is to create a sleek site where you can play a few simple puzzle games. We really wanted to create the
        opposite of what game sites we remembered, like CoolMathGames, were. The New York Times game page is a good
        example of the kind of style that we were trying to achieve with this site.
        While we definitely will not end up with a completely finished product with a diverse cast of games to pick
        from, we hope that this site meets our initial goals of simplicity and ease-of-use.
